# WELCOME TO EV CHARGING STATION
## DESCRIPTION
E-mobility is emerging as one of the fastest mode of trans-portation as it serves zero emission without the use of anyfossile fuel. The cleaner and greener mobility will also     
servein reducing the CO2 emission content in the atmosphereand help to reduce global warming. However, to make thee-mobility grow faster the production and management of 
electricity is of the main objective. The main demand of the electric vehicle is the charging methods and its infrastructure.
