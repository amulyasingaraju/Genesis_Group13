# SDLC Activity Based Learning

# WELCOME TO EV CHARGING STATION
### DESCRIPTION
E-mobility is emerging as one of the fastest mode of trans-portation as it serves zero emission without the use of any fossile fuel. The cleaner and greener mobility will also     serve in reducing the CO2 emission content in the atmosphereand help to reduce global warming. However, to make thee-mobility grow faster the production and management of electricity is of the main objective. The main demand of the electric vehicle is the charging methods and its infrastructure.
