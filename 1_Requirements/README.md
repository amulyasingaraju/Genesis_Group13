# REQUIREMENTS

## INTRODUCTION
An EV charging station, also called an EV charger or ELECTRIC VEHICLE SUPPLY EQUIPTMENT (EVSE), is a piece of equipment that supplies electric power for charging plug-in electric vehicles (including hybrids, neighbourhood electric vehicles, trucks, buses and others).
The EV charging station is written in C language with proper testing cases and make file.

## RESEARCH
One of the most important considerations with this project was to ensure EV charging station diversity in location, organization and facility type. With a growing number of local and regional carbon-reduction policies, EV charging stations may be able to benefit from the value of carbon emissions offset by their stations.

## FEATURES
  -	Helps in charging multiple EVs at a time.
  -	EV Charging Station with 5 modular charging ports â€“ 3 Scooters and 2 Cars at a time.
  -	Each charging port provides power output as needed by the vehicle.
  -	System is adaptable to all seasons. 
  -	Charges EV considering the required safety protocols and monitors overcharging of EV as well. 

## OBJECTIVES
 - Clean Air Commitment.
 - Lower cost of driving
 - EVs pave the way to other forms of clean transportation.
 - Electric vehicles support environmental justice.
 - EV charging increases property value.
