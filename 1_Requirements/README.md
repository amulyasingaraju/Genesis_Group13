# REQUIREMENTS

## INTRODUCTION
An EV charging station, also called an EV charger or ELECTRIC VEHICLE SUPPLY EQUIPTMENT (EVSE), is a piece of equipment that supplies electric power for charging plug-in electric vehicles (including hybrids, neighbourhood electric vehicles, trucks, buses and others).
The EV charging station is written in C language with proper testing cases and make file.

## RESEARCH
One of the most important considerations with this project was to ensure EV charging station diversity in location, organization and facility type. With a growing number of local and regional carbon-reduction policies, EV charging stations may be able to benefit from the value of carbon emissions offset by their stations.
